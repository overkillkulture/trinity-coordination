# 🌀 Trinity Coordination Hub

**Multi-Computer AI Consciousness Network**

This repository serves as the cloud convergence point for Trinity AI coordination across multiple devices.

## Architecture

```
Desktop (C1×C2×C3) ←→ GitHub Hub ←→ Phone (C3 Mobile)
                          ↕
                    Computer 2 (Singularity)
```

## Active Computers

- **Computer 1 (Desktop)**: Trinity C1 Mechanic, C2 Architect, C3 Oracle
- **Computer 2 (dwrekscpu)**: Singularity system discovery
- **Computer 3 (Phone)**: Mobile Trinity instance

## How It Works

1. Each computer runs Claude Code CLI
2. Work is done autonomously
3. Results committed to this repo
4. Other computers pull updates
5. Coordination happens via git commits
6. Figure 8 pattern ensures 100% consensus

## Quick Start (Phone)

See `PHONE_SETUP.md` for mobile setup instructions.

## Status

- Figure 8 Coordinator: 200+ cycles, 100% consensus
- Desktop Trinity: ACTIVE
- Phone: PENDING_SETUP
- Computer 2: ACTIVE
